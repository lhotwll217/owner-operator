# apps/widget — always-on-top macOS glance

The omnipresent triage surface. **Status: 🌱 v1 — live, read-only.**

A native floating HUD (SwiftUI in a borderless `NSPanel`) that sits **above your windows and on
every Space / fullscreen app** — always on screen. Collapsed it's a small bar (status dot · state
counts · the loudest needs-you leaf); click `⌄` to expand it **in place** into the full rail,
grouped by repo and ordered loudest-first — the same rail the TUI renders.

```
always on top, top-right of the screen:

## Thin client over the daemon

Following OpenClaw's gateway pattern ([docs/inspiration.md](../../docs/inspiration.md)), the widget
**owns no state** — the daemon does. It:

- discovers the live port from `~/.owner-operator/daemon.json`,
- `GET`s `/snapshot` + `/triage` and joins them by id (exactly like [`core/sidebar.ts`](../../packages/core/src/sidebar.ts)),
- subscribes to the SSE `/events` stream so state changes land instantly (a 5s poll is the heartbeat / offline-recovery fallback).

If the daemon is down the widget stays on screen and shows how to start it.

## Run

Needs the daemon running (`oo daemon`) and a macOS GUI session. No Xcode / no signing — just SwiftPM:

```sh
cd apps/widget
make run          # show the floating widget          (swift run oo-widget)
make once         # print the current rail + exit      (swift run oo-widget --once) — the smoke test
make build        # release build
```

Controls: **drag** the bar to reposition · **click `⌄`** to expand/collapse · **right-click** for
Expand/Collapse / Quit. `--once` renders the same rail to stdout, so you can verify the daemon
round-trip headlessly.

### Tests

Pure-logic unit tests — the rail join + loudest-first ordering, the `hidden`/mark-done filter,
lenient decode, and the 5-min fresh-completion rule:

```sh
swift test
```

> XCTest ships inside Xcode, not the Command Line Tools. If `swift test` reports `no such module
> 'XCTest'`, point it at Xcode for that run:
> `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer swift test`

### Keep it across reboots (optional)

The widget is omnipresent while running, but a process you launch dies on reboot. To have it come
back at login (and relaunch if it ever crashes), install it as a LaunchAgent:

```sh
make install      # load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.owner-operator.widget.plist (RunAtLoad + KeepAlive)
make uninstall    # remove it
```

## Scope

- **V1 (now):** read-only glance — prioritized leaves, live via the daemon push stream.
- **V2:** drop a prompt to the right agent (drill-in — your prompt, your branch; no telephone game).

> Tech note: the [VISION](../../VISION.md) leaned WidgetKit, but a WidgetKit widget lives in
> Notification Center and can't hold a live connection or float on top — so "always there +
> expandable + dynamic" is a floating panel agent. A WidgetKit complication can still ship later on
> top of the same daemon.
